# Deep Learning for Speech and Language

### Winter Seminar UPC TelecomBCN (January 24-31, 2017)

The aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning for speech and language. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these state of the art tools for time series processing. Engineering tips and scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, speech synthesis or question answering. Hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that attendees can become competent in contemporary data anlaytics tools.

## Registration
Registration procedure depends on the student profile:

* **Master and Phd students at UPC:** Follow [these instructions](http://etsetb.upc.edu/ca/estudis/curs-actual/seminaris/seminars-masters-telecom-electronic-engineering-pla-92) provided by ETSETB academic office. A new period of registration is expected to open during December (contact the academic office for more details).
* **Bachelor students at UPC:** Follow [these instructions](http://etsetb.upc.edu/ca/estudis/curs-actual/seminaris/seminaris-dels-graus) provided by ETSETB academic office. A new period of registration is expected to open during December (contact the academic office for more details).
* **Mobility students:** If your host institution has signed an agreement with UPC ETSETB Telecom BCN school, you can request a mobility from your host institution and sign up for the course under the same conditions as UPC Phd, master or bachelor students.
* **Visiting students:** You must apply for being accepted in the course and cover the 100% cost of the ECTS credits, without the support of the public funds. This corresponds to 143,08 € per ECTS credit (Summer 2016). If you are interested in this option, please contact the [ETSETB Telecom BCN academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta), with an e-mail to
 secretaria@etsetb.upc.edu or calling at 93 405 4174 / 93 401 6772 / 93 401 5966 or 93 401 6750 in the morning (Monday to Thursday from 11 to 14 and Fridays from 11 to 13) or noons (Wednesdays and Thursdays from 16 to 17h).

You are also encouraged to share your questions and solution in the [public issues](https://github.com/telecombcn-dl/2017-dlsl/issues) section for future reference and quality improvement of the course.

## Video recordings

Sessions will be recorded in video and posted afterwards, together with the slides.

## Contact

If you have any general question about the course, please use the public issues section of this repo. Otherwise, you can send an e-mail to  [Xavier Giro-i-Nieto](xavier.giro@upc.edu).

## Sponsorship

We are currently looking for sponsors. Please contact [Antonio Bonafonte](antonio.bonafonte@upc.edu) if you want your company or organization to support this seminar.
